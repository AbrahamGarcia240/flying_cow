# Flying Cow

This is intended to be a tutorial on how to use PyGame.

This code:
  - Creates a game simulating an "skip the bulllets" game
  - Adds sprites to the screen
  - Shows how to move a given sprite
  - Handle events (keys, cron jobs)
  - Detect groups
  - Detect collitions
  - Add music

This is my personal preamble to a bigger project, a flappy bird played by
a nueral network
